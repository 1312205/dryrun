# dryrun
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/dryrun.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/dryrun)

**Try** an **android** library on your **smartphone** **directly** from the **command line**


> A dry run (or a practice run) is a testing process where the effects of a possible failure are intentionally mitigated. For example, an aerospace company may conduct a "dry run" test of a jet's new pilot ejection seat while the jet is parked on the ground, rather than while it is in flight.


## Typical scenario

1. Find the github url (lets say `https://github.com/cesarferreira/android-helloworld`)
2. Click the `download zip`
3. Extract the `zipfile`
4. Open Android Studio
5. Import the project you just downloaded
6. Sync gradle
7. Run the project
8. Choose the device you want to run

... or you can use `dryrun`:

## Usage
```bash
dryrun https://github.com/cesarferreira/android-helloworld
```

Wait a few seconds... and `voilÃ `! The app is installed and opened on your phone :smiley:
