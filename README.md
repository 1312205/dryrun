> A dry run (or a practice run) is a testing process where the effects of a possible failure are intentionally mitigated. For example, an aerospace company may conduct a "dry run" test of a jet's new pilot ejection seat while the jet is parked on the ground, rather than while it is in flight.

## Typical scenario

1. Find the github url (lets say `https://github.com/cesarferreira/android-helloworld`)
2. Click the `download zip`
3. Extract the `zip file`
4. Open Android Studio
5. Import the project you just downloaded
6. Sync gradle
7. Run the project
8. Choose the device you want to run
9. Test all you want
10. Delete the `project folder` and the `zip file` when you don't want it anymore

... or you can use `dryrun`:

## Usage
```bash
dryrun https://github.com/cesarferreira/android-helloworld
```

Wait a few seconds... and `voilÃ `! The app is installed and opened on your phone :smiley:
